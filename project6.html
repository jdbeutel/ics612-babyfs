The goal of this project is to familiarize yourselves with file system
design and implementation.

<p>As before, this is an individual or group project.

<p>As an alternative, some of you may want a more challenging project.
If so, please see at the end.

<h2>Description</h2>

<p> I want you to design a file system that can store up to 10,000
files on a medium up to 2GB in size.  The maximum size of each file is
200MB.  The file system should provide a directory tree with file names
composed of arbitrary characters up to 200 bytes long.  Each block is
1KBytes, which means files and the file system must be able to haandle
up to 2M-1 blocks (2,097,151 blocks, with at least 21 bits per block
number).

<p> The file system does not have to be efficient.  In particular, you
do not need to implement a buffer cache.  Your implementation must limit
itself to using a fixed amount of main memory, on the order of 1MB or
(much) less.

<p> The actual storage on "disk" must be moderately efficient, so that
most of the space on the "disk" should be available for storage of
actual data.

<p> The file system should use block read and write operations provided
by the instructor:

<ul>
<li> <tt>typedef char block [1024]; /* each block is 1KB */</tt>
<li> <tt>int read_block (int block_num, char * block)</tt>
--- returns 0 if the operation is successful, and -1 otherwise
<li> <tt>int write_block (int block_num, char * block)</tt>
--- returns 0 if the operation is successful, and -1 otherwise.  Actually
writes the block to disk
<li> <tt>int dev_open ()</tt>
--- returns the device size (in blocks) if the operation is successful,
and -1 otherwise
</ul>

<p>These are implemented in <a href="block.c"><tt>block.c</tt></a>.  The
first block is block number 0.

<p> <tt>dev_open</tt> accesses blocks in a file named <tt>simulated_device</tt>
in the current directory.  To create the file, use the following command:
<pre>
dd if=/dev/zero of=simulated_device bs=1024 count=x
</pre>
where x is the size (in blocks) of your intended device.  For example,
<pre>
dd if=/dev/zero of=simulated_device bs=1024 count=131072
</pre>
gives you a 128MB device (128K blocks), and
<pre>
dd if=/dev/zero of=simulated_device bs=1024 count=250000
</pre>
gives you a device large enough for the maximum file size that
<tt>testp6</tt> (see below) tries to build.

<p> Your code must implement the following API, inspired by and
simplified from the POSIX file API:
<ul>
<li> <tt>int my_open (char * path)</tt>, to open an exisiting file for
reading or writing
<li> <tt>int my_creat (char * path)</tt>, to open a new file for writing only (fails if the file already exists)
<li> <tt>int my_read (int fd, void * buf, int count)</tt>, to sequentially
read from a file
<li> <tt>int my_write (int fd, void * buf, int count)</tt>, to sequentially
write to a file
<li> <tt>int my_close (int fd)</tt>
<li> <tt>int my_remove (char * path)</tt>
<li> <tt>int my_rename (char * old, char * new)</tt>
<li> <tt>int my_mkdir (char * path)</tt>, only works if all but the last
component of the path already exists
<li> <tt>int my_rmdir (char * path)</tt>
<li> <tt>void my_mkfs ()</tt>, checks to see if the device already has
a file system on it, and if not, creates one.
</ul>

<p> A file providing this API, but not implementing it, is available
at <a href="p6.c"><tt>p6.c</tt></a>.  If you only modify this file,
that is all you have to turn in, otherwise turn in all your files for
this project.  For your convenience, I have also provided <a
href="p6.h"><tt>p6.h</tt></a> and a very simple test program, <a
href="testp6.c"><tt>testp6.c</tt></a>.  This program runs all the
tests unless an optional argument is provided, in which case it runs
all the tests on files whose size (in bytes) is less than or equal to
the argument.  A log of a complete run is <a
href="project6samplelog">here</a>.

<p> Your code does not need to provide protection, multiple links,
access times, or current directories.  You also may assume that each
file will be opened at most once before it is closed again, although
multiple files (up to 10) may be open at the same time.

<p> Your code <b>does</b> need to handle "<tt>/</tt>"-separated paths of
arbitrary depth, and so one useful function you may find yourself
writing may be to parse paths.  You may also want to write some
routines to maintain and access bitmaps on disk.  Of course, all code
you turn in must be yours, but you may draw inspiration from other
code (e.g. Minix 3) as long as you give credit where appropriate.

<p> All your code should run on a Unix compatible system.  You may
use uhunix, or any Linux or BSD system (or even Minix for all I know).
Please let me know what you have used.

<p> You <b>MUST</b> consult with the instructor as early as possible
(preferably before November 10th) to discuss your design and your
strategies for implementation.  You MUST you have at least your data
structures defined, data structures both on disk and in memory, before
you come in to discuss your design.

<p> To read what is stored on your "device", you may run
<pre>
od -t x1 simulated_device | m
</pre>
If you run on a little-endian machine (such as intel architectures),
your numbers will come out "backwards", i.e. with the LSB first, unless
you convert to big-endian before saving on disk (converting is not
particularly recommended).

<h2>Alternative</h2>

<p> As an alternative, some of you may want a more challenging project.
If so, please do the following instead of the above project.

<p> I am unable to mount my minix3 disk image on linux.  As far as I can
tell, the file system has changed.  However, I have found no documentation
for this.

<p> All I have found is commands for mounting specific partitions onto
Linux with an offset corresponding to the size of the first partition.  For
example, running

<pre>
fdisk -l -u -C 592 minix.img 
</pre>

Tells me that the first partition begins at sector 63.  Multiplying 63
by 512, which is the same as <a
href="http://wiki.edseek.com/guide:mount_loopback#mounting_with_a_specified_offset"> here</a>.  But mounting does not work:

<pre>
$ sudo mount -t minix -oloop,offset=32256 minix.img mnt/
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop0,
       missing codepage or helper program, or other error
       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
       dmesg | tail  or so
</pre>

dmesg tells me

<pre>
VFS: Can't find a Minix filesystem V1 | V2 | V3 on device loop0.
</pre>

Minix has no trouble finding the file system, so I suspect the problem
is at the Linux end.

<p> Your task would be to investigate what is going on.  If my assumption
is correct that the Minix file system has changed, then write code for
Linux to make it able to access this new Minix file system.  You would
have to update the code in /usr/src/linux-3.0.4/fs/minix as appropriate.

<p>In Minix itself, the code is in /usr/src/servers/vfs/ .  I assume that
/usr/src/commands/mkfs.mfs/mkfs.c is also up to date.

<p> So one of the reasons this project is challenging is, I am not really
sure what is wrong, and I am not quite sure what you will need to do.

<p> If you do want to do this project, please consult with me frequently,
at least every week.
